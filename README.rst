Every APIS instance is built out of at least three Git repositories: apis-core, a webpage repo (e.g. apis-webpage) and a settings repo (e.g. apis-settings). This is a repo integrating repos for the APIS installation (the project, not the system).

For detailed information on how to install and use the system please refer to the github pages of `apis-core
<https://acdh-oeaw.github.io/apis-core/>`_.
